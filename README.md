# Poly Hobby

## About

Poly Hobby is my first Vue application that I've built to learn the essentials such as reactivity fundamentals, computed properties, list rendering, event handling and more. This application allows users to track their hobbies. Users can add new hobbies, view them in a reverse chronological order, and delete hobbies as needed. Basic styles are implemented using pure CSS.
